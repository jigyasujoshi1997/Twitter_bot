# twitter_bot
A Twitterbot program that integrates with the Twitter platform, automatically posting, retweeting, liking, or following other users. 
Also twitter don't allows to do duplicate tweets so added a random book available free on internet and converted it to .txt file using curl.
Sleep is the delay timer we are putting between tweet as twitter don't allows us to tweet more than 2400 tweet in 24 hours.
